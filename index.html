            <ul>
                <li>Led a five-person Agile team in the development of an autonomous medication dispensing robot, managing sprint
                    planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to ensure timely project completion.
                    </li>
                <li>Integrated ROS (Robot Operating System) and Firebase technologies to enable autonomous navigation, secure
                    patient verification, and real-time tracking of medication dispensing, enhancing the robot's functionality and
                    reliability.
                    </li>
                <li>Delivered a fully functional prototype to Amazon Robotic professionals, earning 3rd place in the capstone

                    </li>
                <li>Optimized speaker relocation strategies by implementing a data-driven approach, clustering programs within 25-
                    mile city radiuses, which reduced travel costs by an estimated 10% or $5,000 over the program's duration.                
                    </li>
                <li>Mentored six HBCU students through a complex healthcare case study during the 2023 TMCF ZS SEED
                    Immersion Program, providing guidance on data analysis, problem-solving, and presentation skills, culminating in
                    all six students successfully presenting their findings to a panel of ZS professionals and receiving positive
                    feedback on their analytical and communication skills.

            <ul>
                <li>Analyzed healthcare affordability across U.S. regions using R, identifying key cost drivers and proposing
                    solutions that could potentially reduce patient medical costs by an average of 20% based on a simulation of
                    10,000 patient records.                                
                    </li>
                <li>Investigated contributing factors to drug abuse in African-American communities revealing that 55% of
                    respondents cited economic hardship as a primary driver, providing valuable insights that were later used to
                    inform a community intervention program that received $20,000 in funding.                
                    </li>
                <li>Completed an R programming course, expanding analytical skills and proficiency with large-scale datasets,
